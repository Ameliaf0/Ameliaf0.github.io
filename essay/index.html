    <p class ="intro">Yin and Yang is a concept from Chinese philosophy that says all aspects of life are governed by two complimentary but opposing forces, for example, masculine and feminine, light and dark, Sun and Moon, etc... It is believed that the balance between these two is imperative, and you cannot have one without the other, but of course this is a very simplified explanation of the concept. In my photo essay I aim to capture the presence of both yin and yang throughout life and the balance between the two. Some of the photos I paired together share similar themes but have opposing details. Some of the photo sets simultaneously have a Yin and Yang relationship to other photosets in terms of lighting, coloring, and overall themes.  Additionally, each individual picture has its own balance between Yin and Yang energy.</p>

        <p class="active">An urban scene featuring an industrial building with a painting of wonder woman. A woman's face in the painting is covered like a mask by a single tree. This image has elements of both Yin and Yang. Wonder woman is a feminine figure yet she is brave and powerful. The trees soften the image while providing a sense of mystery with their placement, while the urban setting makes the environment feel harsher. The sky in the background is bright but cloudy. The contrast between these elements makes the image more interesting to look at.</p>
        <p>A bright brick wall with green vines holding vibrant          
            flowers climbing up its side. This image at first glance may appear more feminine but its bright color and lively energy align more with Yang, the masculine element.      
</p>
        <p>This image of a cold dark stone wall on the other hand with its various iron mirrors may seem masculine at first glance, however it's cold and dark energy aligns with the feminine element Yin.</p>
    
        <p>Here we see a bustling local restaurant where friends hug
        each other and families gather to watch live. The energy is energetic and inviting.

                                                                                                      painting of musicians.
