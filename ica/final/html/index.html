        <h2>Hi, I'm Amelia</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Amelia! I am currently working towards a degree in Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, with minors in both Music and Creative Technology and Design.  After I complete my undergraduate degree, I am eager to pursue a Master's degree in Creative Technology and Design at the University of Colorado Boulder, to increase my skillset and experience. The more I learn about the implications of technology and who is designing it, the more my enthusiasm for contributing to the production of meaningful technology grows. 
  
            As I explore my creativity, I find my style aligns the most with using art as a tool to make people think about concepts outside of what we have been conditioned to believe. As a designer, I focus on creating intuitive interfaces by merging aesthetics with functionality and increasing accesibility to create the best possible experience for users. As an artist and a human being, I draw my inspiration from space. Claude Debussy, a French classical composer, said “Music is the space between the notes.” To me, space represents untapped potential, moments of reflection, and the things unseen on the surface level. 
  
           I bring my creations to life using  my skills and experience with data analysis, quantitative and qualitative data collection,  graphic design, UX/UI design, and front-end programming. I am interested in roles that will allow me to explore my passions while improving the world for a diverse range of my fellow humans.</p>
