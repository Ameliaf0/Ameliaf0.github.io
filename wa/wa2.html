        <p>I'm a junior at CU Boulder majoring in Information Science with minors in Music and Creative Technology and Design. I'm originally from Estes Park Colorado, but I also lived in Texas when I was a kid. Outside of school I like singing, baking, and hanging out with my friends.</p>
        <p>My goal for this coarse is to be able to create a new  <a href="https://amfi5890.wixsite.com/ameliafichera-1">portfolio website</a>with my own code or at least something I can showcase in my portfolio</p>
        <h1>This is a picture of my and my roommates cat Kiki. As you can see Kiki is like the chunkiest cat I've ever met in my life so he's perfect for cuddling (he hates it though)</h1>
